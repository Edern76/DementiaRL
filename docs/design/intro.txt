The story you're about to witness takes place in Ashotara, a world filled with deadly monstruosities and dangerous beasts, a world constantly riven by conflicts betsween kingdoms, a world where chaos governs the very life of each of its inhabitants.
And still, this world has yet to know the greatest peril it has ever experienced.

Zarg was revered as one of the most powerful mages of Ashotara. He always put his powers at the service of the greater good, and despite having been promised countless times fortunes by the rulers of the many kingdoms of Ashotara for doing so, he never picked a side in any of the many armed conflicts driven by greed, hatred or envy.

However, despite his tremendous powers, Zarg was still a human. And as all humans, his mind was susceptible to temptation. Indeed, he was constantly obsessed with finding ways to increase his magical abilities, so as to be able to protect the defenseless from any opponent, no matter how strong or numerous they could be. Though is motives were noble, little did he know that such lust for might would lead him to [become said opponent/walk the path of darkness].

Therefore, when he learned about the existence of the [Orb/Cube/Amulet/Ring/Whatever] of [Yendor/Yindorre/Else?], a mysterious artifact from another dimension, enclosing unmatched amounts of pure energy so prodigious that they could turn a mere mortal into a god, he immediately set out on a journey through the tallest mountains and the deepest seas, through the greatest perils and the direst ordeals, <to go where no man ever had the courage to go> in order to retrieve the [Orb/Cube/Amulet/...].
