HOW TO CREATE DIALOG FOR AN NPC :
    1) Create choices associated with a certain screen
    2) Create list containing these choices, even if there is only one choice.
    3) Create screen associated to these choices and pass the list you created earlier to it.
    4) Repeat 1, 2 and 3 until you have all the screens you want
    5) Create a list containing all of these screens
    6) Create a new dialog tree and pass the list of all its screens to it.
    7) Import said tree into main and associate it to the NPC of your choice
    
FOLLOWING THESE STEPS IN THE EXACT ORDER THEY ARE WRITTEN IN IS CRUCIAL. Stuff WILL break if you don't. 
It is highly advised to write down all the screens with their respective choices and text, and how they are linked together, before starting to implement them.
